Implement console program which will meet the following requirements:
    a. Implement a hierarchy of Sweets. All Sweets should have next properties:
        name, weight and sugarWeight. Weight is a weight of the specific sweet in
        kilograms. sugarWeight is a weight of sugar in this sweet in kilograms.

        I don’t want to give you specific directions here to give you an opportunity to
        decide what will work the best here to start describing the Sweet hierarchy: an
        interface or an abstract class?

    b. Candy, Lollipop and Cookie - three other types from Sweet hierarchy.

    c. Create class Present. Present has next behavior:
        ```
            // the method filters sweets by sugar weight inclusively
            public Sweet[] filterSweetsBySugarRange(double minSugarWeight,
            double maxSugarWeight) {
            <write your code here>
            }
            // the method calculates total weight of the present
            public double calculateTotalWeight() {
            <write your code here>
            }
            // the method that adds sweet to the present
            public void addSweet(Sweet sweet) {
            <write your code here>
            }
            // the method returns copy of the Sweet[] array so that nobody could
            // modify state of the present without addSweet() method.
            // Also array shouldn’t contain null values.
            public Sweet[] getSweets() {
            <write your code here>
            }
        ```
